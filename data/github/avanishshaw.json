      "text": "Hey Team @Jacobjeevan  @rithviknishad ,\n\nI’d like to take up this issue and work on resolving it.\nMy plan is to ensure that both the text and the checkbox are perfectly aligned for a cleaner, more consistent UI. I’ll be using appropriate Tailwind CSS utility classes to achieve proper vertical and horizontal alignment, while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility standards.\n\nETA: 1 day — I’ll aim to have the changes implemented, tested, and ready for review within this timeframe."
