Make it responsive around all devices.\nI will integrate this Accordion into the Health Profile section of the Patient Home Page, specifically wrapping the Medication Statement content.\nThe Accordion component will be made reusable and can later be used in other areas of the application (e.g., Lab Results, Allergies) wherever collapsible sections are needed.\n\nEnd Date:2 Days"
