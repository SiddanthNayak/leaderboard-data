      "text": "Hey Team @Jacobjeevan @rithviknishad ,\n\nHi , I noticed this issue is already assigned, but I’ve implemented a fix locally. If the current assignee isn’t actively working on it, I’d be happy to open a PR and contribute. Please let me know if that would be helpful.\n\nMy plan is to ensure that both the checkbox and its accompanying text are properly aligned for a cleaner, more consistent UI. I’ll be using appropriate Tailwind CSS utility classes to fix vertical and horizontal alignment while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility.\n\n\n<img width=\"655\" height=\"127\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c6550a9-e1ce-4dab-8feb-786031dfd61d\" />\n\n\nThe changes are already implemented and tested locally — I can open a PR as soon as I get the go-ahead.\n\n\n\nThanks for your time and effort in maintaining this project — have a great day!\n\n"
