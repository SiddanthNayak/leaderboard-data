While the status \"approved\" appears correctly as \"Approved\", other statuses like \"transfer_in_progress\" and \"transportation_to_be_arranged\" are displayed as raw keys.\n\nRoot Cause:\nThese specific status keys (\"transfer_in_progress\", \"transportation_to_be_arranged\", etc.) are missing from the en.json translation file, so the t() function returns the raw key instead of a user-friendly, translated string.\n\nETA: TODAY\n\n@rithviknishad "
